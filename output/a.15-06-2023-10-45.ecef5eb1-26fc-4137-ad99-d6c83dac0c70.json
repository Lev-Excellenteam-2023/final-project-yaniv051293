REST API is a type of architecture used for building web services, allowing different applications to communicate with each other over the internet. Flask is a lightweight web framework in Python, known for its simplicity and extensibility. The Requests library, on the other hand, is a powerful tool for making HTTP requests and handling responses in Python. Together, they provide a convenient and efficient way to create and interact with REST APIs."

Networking ports are assigned numerical values ranging from 0 to 65535, with well-known ports (0-1023) being designated for specific protocols or services, and dynamic or private ports (1024-65535) available for applications or services to use dynamically. By combining the IP address and port number, network devices can establish connections and route data to the correct application or service running on a specific device within a network."

        "slide summary": "This page explains the concept of TCP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol. TCP is a reliable and connection-oriented protocol that is commonly used for communication over IP networks. Its main function is to guarantee the accurate and error-free delivery of data between two devices. To establish a connection, TCP uses a three-way handshake mechanism, where a series of messages are exchanged between a client and a server to synchronize and establish a reliable connection before any data transmission takes place."

        "slide summary": "Page 5 explains the basics of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which is used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It operates over the Internet or other computer networks and follows a client-server model. In this model, the client (typically a web browser) sends requests to the server and receives responses in return. HTTP uses a request-response paradigm, where the client sends a request and the server responds with data or an error message. It is a stateless protocol, meaning that each request is independent of previous requests and the server does not retain any information about past requests from a specific client."

        "slide summary": "Page 6 of this article covers the topic of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). The article explains that HTTP supports different methods or verbs, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., which specify the actions to be performed on the server's resources. It also mentions that HTTP uses URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) to indicate the location of resources on the web. Additionally, the article highlights that HTTP messages consist of a request line for client requests or a status line for server responses, along with headers and an optional message body. Lastly, it briefly touches on the fact that HTTP can be encrypted using HTTPS (HTTP Secure) for secure communication over the network. An example from Wireshark is provided as well."

        "slide summary": "This page provides a brief explanation of HTTP usage and its primary purpose, which is to enable the retrieval and display of web pages and related content. It also highlights that HTTP is widely used as the underlying protocol for API communication. APIs that use HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE are used to perform operations on server resources, allowing clients to retrieve, create, update, or delete data. HTTP APIs often utilize structured data formats like JSON or XML to represent and transmit data between clients and servers, making data exchange more efficient and easier for different systems to understand and process."

Flask allows developers to easily create web applications and RESTful APIs with minimal boilerplate code. It is known for its simplicity and flexibility, making it popular among developers who want a lightweight framework that can be easily customized. Flask also supports various extensions that enhance its functionality, such as authentication, database integration, and form validation. Overall, Flask is a powerful tool for building web applications quickly and efficiently."

        "slide summary": "On this page, we learn about routing in Flask. Routing in Flask refers to the process of mapping URLs to specific functions or methods within a Flask application. By defining routes using decorators, such as @app.route('/path'), Flask makes it easy to associate URLs with specific functions. Additionally, Flask supports dynamic routing, which means you can define variables within route paths. This feature allows you to handle different URL patterns and extract values from the URL for further processing."

REST API is an architectural style used for designing networked applications that rely on standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources. These resources are identified and located using uniform resource identifiers (URIs). In REST API, client-server communication follows a stateless model, meaning the server does not store any client state between requests. Therefore, every client request must include all the necessary information for the server to understand and process it."
